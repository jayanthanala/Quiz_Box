//still the student schema must be changed and try to add a roll number in it and try to fetch the students using roll number only!!!



////////////////////////////////////// JAYANTH'S ToDo ////////////////////////////////////////

1. Adding exam id to student's exam id array while adding him through csv file.
2. Check the Completed exam route (student)
3. An error occurred in Staged Exams (teacher).






*schema for both teacher and student --
*authentication and auth routes for student and teacher  --
*schema for exam,response,question

//TEACHER
*setup the route for dashboard, initially only one button for creating an exam!
****setting up the exam form!*****=>styling also simultaneously or this form
*post route handling for the form
*add tool bar for dashborad, with ongoing,completed,staged,sheduled(leave the functionality of this for now!)


* completing the post route of /ecam/staged and /exam/edit also!

*staged is the area where the exam created is still there on staged! once they click on the exam, edit form appears(teachers can edit the exam anytime in this staged area!)
 once modifications and reviewed! a button is present in the staged window, tick box for review and then submit!
 *Exam removed from staged area and now visible in ongoing!
/////////////////////////////////
*excel file , random excel files must also be used! so just check all the attributes and then take the roll numbers

///////////////////
date-time local doesn't work in mozilla
/////////////////

 *start the exams tab !
 * add copy on select to the access code
 *can click the exam on ongoing for receiving the responses(but this page might use socket!for real time submissions and graphs and all!)
 *once exam done, it is present in the completed window there socket not required! as no further submissions!

* if marks changed in the form ! then change the marks in the left side also!
//try


* in edit page, after posting we nee to heck whether the titel has been changed or not! if it is changed then change it in exam object also
or else just don't give an option to change the title.



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
NOT DONE YET (REQUIRES STUDETNT SIDE UPDATION)
*****bad idea to have a slot in which at any time studetns can give the test in that slot! think about a good idea (so remove the code which we did for this functionality)!
1)add the exam id's to the students when the exam is submitted from the staged area! && add the exam id's to the students when the students are added seperately from exams tab && when from student side access code is entered!
****using these exam id's ------show the exam to the students under upcoming dashboard and few details but don't show the start button(even in that page keep the content refresh for every 5s)
    but when exam status is set to ready from the backend then after refresh exam must come under the ongoing tab! (duration+10s for instaructions page reading!if user enters late give him a grace time of 5s if he is late by more than 5s then start reducing the duration)
##### how to resolve the issue of student entering the exam late??????? ------Teacher will give an input for last time for exam to be started! (5 mins or 3 mins ..) after that user if clicks start also can't proceed to the exam (middle ware of the route check the system time and the time already spent and the given time limit from the teacher)
**********complete the edit exam************************

///////////////
handle the error caused due to no file upload from staged page.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
1)setup socket on both server and view responses webpage
2)set time interval for that webpage (go on sendign message which includes the exam id!) ---- collect it on the server, check the exam whether status completed or still started
3)send the responses of this exam id and even the questions of this exam id.
4)in the web page maintain an array,push all the responses to it for the first time. and then on wards keep on checking the length of this array and the received array and if both different then add the remaining responses tot eh array and even update on the page.



**************
fix the error of duration of undefined line 588 ! comes after restarting server.....




////////////////////////////todo
1) auto scroll whenever the + is pushed or - is pushed
2)usage of fs to delete the excel file once the exam is started
3) give the authentication middleware for the responses get route

/////////////////////////implementaion of quiz submission
1)name=q[question id] ; value = can be option number
2)
array =Object.keys(q)
array.forEach((x)=>{
 Question.findById(x,(e,qu)=>{
   if(q[x]!=null){
   if(q[x]==qu.ans){
   marks+=qu.marks;
   qu.correct+=1;
   }else{
   qu.wrong+=1
   }
   }else{
   qu.unattempted+=1;
   }
  qu.save(()=>{});
 })
})


/





///////////////////////////////////////add socket programming for the exam page of the student!
1) already the in socket code it keeps on checking whether the exam is in the status completed or not ! once it gets completed! just io.emit("examcompleted")
2)recieve it only on the students quiz page! and then using dom auto submit the form!



///////////////////////
CHANGE THE START EXAM HREF !!!! OF THE STUDENTS SIDE


////////////////////////////////REFRESH`
REFRESH THE INDEX PAGE OF THE STUDENT EVERY 5 SECONDS!
AND EVEN THE STUDENTS LIST PAGE AFTER EVERY 5SECONDS!



*****how to handle a hell lot of number of users at a time ? *******************************


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
change the responses.ejs to responses.html
getting the initial data can be done using socket!



role=1 ----teachers




//////////////////////
add required to the inputs of the forms





/////////////////////////////////////////////////in v2 actually implement it now!!!!
1)adding a functionality that teacher specifieds the time test to be closed in addition to the duration!
2)then student will be able to join and take the test in any duration block between that block given by teacher!
3) ex: starts at 10:00 am ends at 10:30am ; duration :10mmins
student10:20 -----ends at 10:30!
student 10:10----ends at 10:20
student >10:20---penalty of those many mins that is 10:23 ----ends at 10:30 -----only 7 mins as he was late!!!!
